Movie maker
============

The ``movie_maker.py`` file contains the ``Setting`` class which sets the setting for our camera. It also contains the ``Animation`` class which produces the image files to be used in producing movies. Please note that this class may contain some errors due to time constraints. The draft scripts contain the individual methods used in this class and will work properly. 

Annotations in the file explain what is done in every method concisely.
